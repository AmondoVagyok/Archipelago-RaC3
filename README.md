## When the player receives an item, what happens?

You will be able to visit the planets with whatever post-planet you receive, receiving Post Marcadia will unlock Aquatos for travel within Ratchet's Ship. Upon receiving a weapon it unlocks in ratchet's inventory, which will let you equip it and use to fire on enemy troops. Progressive upgrades will upgrade your weapons from V1 up to V5 increasing their firepower. Receiving Inferno Mode and Jackpot Mode filler items acts like you just broke the corresponding crates. However, receiving Inferno Mode will not change your armor, but you will still receive the full effect.
