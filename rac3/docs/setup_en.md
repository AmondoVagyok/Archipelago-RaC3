## Required Software

- [v1.6.0 of PCSX2](https://pcsx2.net/downloads)

## Configuring your YAML file

### What is a YAML file and why do I need one?

Your YAML file contains a set of configuration options which provide the generator with information about how it should
generate your game. Each player of a multiworld will provide their own YAML file. This setup allows each player to enjoy
an experience customized for their taste, and different players in the same multiworld can all have different options.

### Where do I get a YAML file?

You can customize your options by visiting
the [Ratchet and Clank 3 Options Page](/games/Ratchet%20and%20Clank%203%20Up%20your%20Arsenal/player-options).

### Connect to the MultiServer

1. Launch PCSX2 and boot your copy of RaC3

2. Launch RaC3AP.exe from the client folder
    - Under address input your archipelago connection address (ie: archipelago.gg:51780)
    - PCSX2 must be open before the RaC3 client is opened or it will give an error
